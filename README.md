# Overview

This is a Ruby on Rails web application that interacts with a stock price API to display stock price data on a webpage.

To start the server run `rails server` in the command line while in the directory of the project and the web server will run on https://localhost:3000

I wrote this software as the beginning of a stock option paper trading application. For now the data is about stocks but eventually I would like to move to options as well and create the logic to participate in paper trading.

# Web Pages

1. Home page: Displays information about the web application.
2. Individual Stock Information: Displays price data about the individual stock.

I developed this application in Visual Studio Code in the Ruby language using the Rails framework.

# Future Work

* Connect application to an API that works with option data.
* Process and parse the data into a database in order to allow paper trading logic.
* Paper trading logic.
